The simplest use of *speakable* has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.\n\n2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the [[cssSelector]] property.\n\n3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the [[xpath]] property.\n\n\nFor more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this\nwe define a supporting type, [[SpeakableSpecification]]  which is defined to be a possible value of the *speakable* property.\n         "

For example, \"2015-11/..\" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated.",
